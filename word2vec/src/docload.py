1. load_book(): Return list of words and word counter for document.
    Also basic document statistics.
2. build_dict(): Build word -> integer dictionary
3. doc2num(): Transform document word list to integer numpy array
4. build_word_array(): Convenience function that runs 3 functions
    above to build an integer numpy word array from a file.
5. save_word_array(): Save a word array and dictionary to file for
    future fast loading.
6. save_word_array(): Load previously saved word array and dictionary.
